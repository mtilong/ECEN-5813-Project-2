# Project Comment.

1. It is recommended that the project show a timing example or diagram as to how the light should blink. 
2. Also a data sheet should of the FRDM KL25Z should come with the project since this project is an intro the the KL25Z. It will help user to learn how to set up registers. 
3. The main issure encountered has been figuring out the proper board clock rate and the proper PC clock rate.
